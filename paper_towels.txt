Hear me out.

Paper towel companies, don't make money off the actual dispenser.
They make it by selling you the paper towels, its a reoccuring buy, and it will be a constant need for these things.
Just think of all the possibilities there are in the world for reoccuring purchases like this.
You could be rich in a month gng
