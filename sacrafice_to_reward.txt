Heres a hell of a take before I go to sleep.

If you truly think you want something, ask yourself, what will it take to get there?  What am I willing to give to make it to that point?
If you truly want it that bad, you would give up your entire self, personality, state of mind, and your overall existance or how you live.
Heres a task for reading this:  Go find something, not a physical objeect, or direct answer, but something plentiful to you.

For example, I have given up my state of mind, and basically my entire self to become wealthy.  Not particularly with money, but with
who I surround myself with, what memories I make, what decisions I choose, and what will fulfil me most in my life.

Write out your plans, how will you achieve the goals, review it daily, edit, plan, fix, and execute.

I have committed myself to getting money first, it seems like i'm wasting my young age but I feel that once I get enough of this
essentially paper, I can retire my mom, my sister won't have to work, I will have enough time on my hands that I can expirience what I want to.
From there on I can basically live the life I have dreamed of, not the glamorous instagram post life, but a fulfilled life with friends and family.

Last thing before I quit typing for the night:
Ask yourself this right now, "Where am I in my life?".  Think deeply about this, your choices, your decisions, even how you think of yourself as a person.
This should give you enough mental clarity to figure out where you are, compared to where you want to be.  Compare constantly, and figure out what
needs to change to get to your goals.
