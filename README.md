## This is as free as it gets. ⛓️‍💥

I will be making text files in this repository, every day, directly from me.  
They will be filled with the following:
- Buisness Ideas
- Random Thoughts
- Website Ideas
- App Ideas
- Anything Else I Think Of

Some ideas will be insanely detailed and comprehensive, possibly even having guides or something of that sort.  Others however, it just depends on the day, I could write 1 whole sentance, or I could write a full essay + research to go with it.

## To Put It Simply 📃
This is my open source journal.  Anything thats here, you can take and use it in your own way, weather its starting a buisness, or building a site.
Some of these ideas will probably be put to use in my other repositories, and if you see something you want to see built, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/FLGM-OG/Brainless-Ideas/pulls) or an [Issue](https://github.com/FLGM-OG/Brainless-Ideas/issues)
